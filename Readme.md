### Background
Over half of Americaâ€™s population does not exercise regularly even though it is essential for maintaining good health. From the conducted field study, it was concluded that people that exercise with friends stay more motivated to exercise than those who work out alone. This project seeks to promote physical activity by providing an application for users who would like to do outdoor mobile exercise such as running in groups. It will help users create groups in which they can schedule runs with other members of the group. The app will keep runners connected even if they do not run at the same pace. It seeks to facilitate the act of getting motivated and motivating others to exercise as well as the ability to communicate from different geographic locations while undergoing intense athletic activity. The target demographic is English-speakers in the United States who would like to run with companions.
